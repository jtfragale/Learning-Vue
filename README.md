#Learning Vue.js

I chose Vue.js because I have seen it appear in job descriptions so I thought it would be useful tool to learn.

View was created by Evan You who worked for Google. It was released in 2014.

##Vue Basics:

    *framework for building UI's
    *library focused on view layer only, can integrate other libraries or other projects
    *uses directives: start with v- and apply actions that are rendered in the DOM
    *can bind data to text, attributes and structure of DOM

I tried using the tutorial on vuejs.org but found it to be a bit overwhelming so I used other resources I found including Laracasts

The app that I set up is a very basic todo list that allows the user to update the list.
